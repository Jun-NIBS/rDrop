Basics of dropbox

Why not use a loca folder that automatically updates?

Can do this with calls to system commands. Not very portable
and unnecessary reading and writing to disk. Also lose
control over the communication (persistent connections),
not as secure (secrets as command line arguments)
Better to do it directly in R.

Dropbox API is REST and JSON based.
Uses OAuth 1.0 to 

The basic operations are 
  get and put a document
  search for text
  information about a document
  information about the account and user

  share a document

  list directory
  create directory
  copy, move/rename, delete

  revisions
  restore

  chunked upload

Add save and load for R objects

We can use a DropboxCredentials object to invoke methods with
  drop$get("filename")
  drop$delete("filename")
  drop[["filename"]]

The top-level/root dropbox versus other.

Give an example/case study of how we would use this and for what purpose.
