* [Done] Constructor for DropboxCredentials object, separate from dropbox_oauth
  Document this.

* Documentation for classes, etc.

* Handle case for dropbox_copy when a DropboxFolder is used for the cred and get the relative paths correct
   Somewhat ambigiuous whether both of the from and to paths should be
   relative to the dropbox folder.  Allow for a absolute path name,
   e.g. dropbox_copy(folder, "/a/b/c", "localNameInFolder")
   Also allow to name to be omitted when folder implies the same name.

* Class for a path/folder that extends DropboxCredentials and then
  uses this to fill the path in requests
  Use getPath() to compute the actual path for the requests.
  [Done] sanitize_path()
  Implement/Check all functions that need to use this.

    [Done] up to dropbox_create_folder

* [Done] Switched to dir() function and generic
  Fix default method for ls() to get correct environment
  e.g. ls(2) getting the wrong environment when called from within a function.

* Fill in getPath() for corner cases (leading /, empty paths)
  Fix // cases but not in URL's http://....

* Large files not uploading correctly
  Use chunked upload
  See dropbox_chunked.r.  Problem with signature.

* Optionally avoid check.if.exists 
  Add .checkIfExists = TRUE to functions.
  Perhaps use a getOption() for the default value.

* Allow caching of the folder
   Sync API to be informed of update.

   use the hash from the /metdata request header.

* Conditions and classes for errors.
  see raiseError() in errors.R
  Used in some functions - grep for stop()

* Suppress warning message about "No inputs passed to form" from dropbox_acc_info
   In ROAuth.  

* Option for list = true for the dropbox_dir() function

* Why not have dropbox_get and _put use the same parameter name for the file.
  _put has what and filename.  _get has file_to_get.
  Probably use filename for both.

* get content type correct for dropbox_save

* have dropbox_save handle ... as named objects
   and make it behave better than save which looks for global variables. 
   Allow both.

[Done] Ensure dropbox_get obeys the binary
  o = dropbox_get(drop, "x.rda", binary = TRUE)

* Have dropbox_get detect binary.
