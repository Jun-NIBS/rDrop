[Done] Constructor for DropboxCredentials object, separate from dropbox_oauth
  Document this

* Documentation for classes, etc.

* Handle case for dropbox_copy when a DropboxFolder is used for the cred and get the relative paths correct

* Class for a path/folder that extends DropboxCredentials and then
  uses this to fill the path in requests
  Use getPath() to compute the actual path for the requests.
  [Done] sanitize_path()
  Implement/Check all functions that need to use this.

    [Done] up to dropbox_create_folder

* [Done] Switched to dir() function and generic
  Fix default method for ls() to get correct environment
  e.g. ls(2) getting the wrong environment

* Fill in getPath() for corner cases (leading /, empty paths)
  Fix // cases but not in URL's http://....

* Large files not uploading correctly
  Use chunked upload

* Optionally avoid check.if.exists 
  Add .checkIfExists = TRUE to functions.
  Perhaps use a getOption() for the default value.

* Allow caching of the folder
   Sync API to be informed of update.

   use the hash from the /metdata request header.

* Conditions and classes for errors.
  see raiseError() in errors.R
  Used in some functions - grep for stop()

* Suppress warning message about "No inputs passed to form" from dropbox_acc_info
   In ROAuth.  

* Option for list = true for the dropbox_dir() function

* Why not have dropbox_get and _put use the same parameter name for the file.

* get content type correct for dropbox_save

* have dropbox_save handle ... as named objects
 and make it behave better than save which looks for global variables. 
 Allow both.

[Done] Ensure dropbox_get obeys the binary
  o = dropbox_get(drop, "x.rda", binary = TRUE)

* Have dropbox_get detect binary.
