why not have dropbox_get and _put use the same parameter
name for the file.

get content type correct for dropbox_save

have dropbox_save handle ... as named objects
 and make it behave better than save which looks for global variables. 
 Allow both.

[Done] Ensure dropbox_get obeys the binary
  o = dropbox_get(drop, "x.rda", binary = TRUE)

Have dropbox_get detect binary.
